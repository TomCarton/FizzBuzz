# FizzBuzz
An exercice given to candidates as follow:

**Exercice:**

     Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
     But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and
     for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
     For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

**We expect the candidate to:**

* write this from scratch (or with a few try & retry).
* compile it through command line.
* write unit tests (as a big plus).
